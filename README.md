# Quantum_Channel_Approximation
I messed up in properly using Github and trying to merge the different versions and functionalities and decided it would be easier to start a new repository.

Python code for simulating quantum channels using quantum computers.

Used python packages:
- Numpy, qutip, scipy, matplotlib, random, math, re, time, torch, itertools, more_itertools, multiprocessing

Lindbladian_via_stinespring is the main file that can be run to use the full program. This file is set up in various blocks:
- Setting up parameters
    parameters are for setting the original lindbladian to apprimate, 
    defining the type of circuit used to make the approximation, 
    and setting the parameters for training the circuit.
- Initialize the class
- Define the evolution operator of the lindbladian (1-3 qubits, TFIM or simple decay with rabi oscillations and rydberg interaction)
- Manually set the initial training data and plot the exact solution of the lindbladian
- Train the unitary in full via class functions
- Reapply the unitary via class functions to investigate the quality of the approximation.

The files have internal documentation per function and class.

The Example_{} files are copies of Lindbladian_via_stinespring with some example settings and can be run directly.
